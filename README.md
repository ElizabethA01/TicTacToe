# TicTacToe

I created a back end application using Java to create a tic tac toe game as a personal project. This helped me to combine all the basic syntax 
I had learned from freeCodeCamp.


# How to Play

You select a box and the computer then plays against you. The purpose of the game is to get 3 in a row.
